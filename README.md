### hello there ^.^

i'm rail 🦊🏳️‍⚧️, a Polish fox living in Brittany, France 🇪🇺

You probably won't see me doing a lot in here, but my interests include (and are not limited to): wiki software, software localization, touching linux, amateur radio and more ^^

More activity may or may not be found at [my Forgejo account](https://git.vulpinecitrus.info/rail).

Go see my website at [flufftech.net](https://flufftech.net), i have [a blog](https://flufftech.net/posts/) over there as well!

Woof!
